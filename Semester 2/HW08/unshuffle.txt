Algorithm to unshuffle a deck of cards:
1. Split the deck of cards into 1-4 piles, one per suit.
2. Split each pile into 2 piles, and continue splitting each pile until each pile has only one card.
3. Combine and sort the smallest files possible, only two piles joining at a time. Think: insertion sort, but insertion merge.
4. Repeat for any other suit piles. 
5. Merge suit piles. Deck is now sorted.
